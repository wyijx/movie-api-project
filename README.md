This project is based on a Pre-set up C# ASP.NET backend which provides a MoviesAPI to our front-end which is Angular.  The project is a 'Movies List' which can display a movies list provided by the API and also utilizes the API to sort the Movie List by Genre.  

This project starts with a home page which shows 25 favorites returned by the API that you may search through by name.

It also features a fortune cookie service which will provide you one of three random cookie phrases.
